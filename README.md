# What I did?
So, I change the game which @simondevyoutube made and turn a little bit more detailed.
This is wht I add or change:
- Add Day/Night Cycle
- Add a sun & a sky with "normal" colors
- Change the chararcter & its animations
- Build in three.js a castle
- Add texture 4K texture to the ground & to the castle
- Build in three.js a lamp which immits light with an PointLight
- Use PBR to render the lights, so that use real physics light calculation
- Add a free camera
- Correct the lights for the night using a diference of 2 sigmoid functions(I made them myself trying to achieve a good transition. It took a good amount of time :sweat:, but I'm really happy of the result :smile:)
